# What is a ContentProvider and what is it typically used for?

A ContentProvider manages access to a structured set of data. It encapsulates the data and provide mechanisms for defining data security. ContentProvider is the standard interface that connects data in one process with code running in another process.

Helps an application manage access to data store by itself, by others and provides a way to share the data.

Name a example of one:
- Calendar
- Contacts

They have pre defined attributes.
