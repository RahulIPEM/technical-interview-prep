# What is a static method?

A method that does not need to be instantiate and can "stand" on it's own.

# What is an inner class?

It is a method written inside another class.


# Static Inner vs Non Static Inner Class

An inner class cannot be static.

# Static and non static nested class

A non-static nested class has full access to the members of the class within which it is nested.

A static nested class does not have a reference to a nesting instance, so a static nested class cannot invoke non-static methods or access non-static fields of an instance of the class within which it is nested.
